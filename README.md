# Discogs V2 Starter

This repo follows up on the intial work with the Discogs API.

* It takes an artist id (defined in `js/index.js`) and renders their name to the DOM
* It performs a lookup for artist releases, based on the url returned from the artist lookup
* It includes the [Bulma CSS Framework](https://bulma.io/documentation/overview/) to provide some overall styling
* It includes some basic styles in `css/styles.css` to override the Bulma defaults and customize the page

This starter will be the baseline for in-class work.
